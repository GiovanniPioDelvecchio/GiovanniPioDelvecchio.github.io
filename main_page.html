			<p> This project replicates the results of the paper "The comparisons of data mining techniques for the predictive
                accuracy of probability of default of credit card clients", by I-Cheng Yeh <br> and
                Che-hui Lien in a distributed setting.<br> Six different Data Mining methods
                were trained in a Hadoop, Yarn and Spark environment: approximated KNN,
                Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multi-layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression,
                Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. The results were compared by means of
                the area ratios of the cumulative gain charts and the regression lines in the
                scatterplots obtained by plotting the probabilities computed by each model
                and the "true" probabilities of default obtained by means of the "Sorting

			<p> This project is related to the Touché23-ValueEval challenge, consisting in a multi-label text classification problem
                where the goal is to extract values, such as Humility, Hedonism, and Achievement, from arguments, which are composed by "Premise", "Consequence" and
                "Stance" (which creates a link between the first two components). <br> The problem
                was tackled through a pipeline consisting in: dataset cleaning and splitting
                according to unique conclusions; training of the deep neural network models;
                evaluation of the models based on F1-macro and analysis of the most difficult
                classes to predict. <br> Three architectures were proposed:
                GloVe embedding + Bi-GRU + flatten + dense;
                BERT + Bi-LSTM + dense (transfer learning).
                Fine-tuned BERT + dense layers.</p></div>

                employed) followed by a RNN-based decoder and a sampler to predict the
                next word for the answer. <br> The training dataset is CoQa. Some variations
                of the baseline-model included the use of beam search and the addition of
                history, results were compared by means of the F1-macro scores.

                NLTK corpus for POS-tagging. Different variations of the same architecture
                were analyzed, comparing the F1-macro scores.

                associated with people with more friends than they have. <br> This phenomenon
                was replicated in an agent-based environment by using two models for graph
                formation (Erdős–Rényi and Barabási–Albert) and three different models for
                network dynamics (randomly add and remove links, add and remove links
                according to a genetic algorithm, add and remove links according to a game
                theory approach). The analysis was performed by observing the distributions
                of neighbors, of neighbors of neighbors and the clustering coefficient.</p></div>

                spatial packing problem. The optimization models needed to solve a plethora
                of instances were developed using the SAT and SMT solver Z3, the Constraint
                Programming environment MiniZinc (using Chuffed as solver) and the MIP
                solvers CPLEX and Gurobi. Apart from the CP model, the code was entirely

                is fed to the RoBERTa tokenizer, then the tokenized comments are fed to the
                model, which is the concatenation of a frozen RoBERTa model, a bidirectional
                LSTM layer, a self attention layer and a combination of convolutions, max
                pooling, dropout and dense layers in order to compute the probabilities of
                each of the seven sentiments involved.

			<p> The project consists in the design of Bayesian Networks to perform queries over 
                the features of a dataset of credit card clients. <br>
                Two networks were designed and compared using the BIC score: one created by considering
                the correlation matrix and selecting an ordering of the features; the other was created by feeding
                the dataset to the hillclimb algorithm.
                Various queries were performed to test the accuracy of the best network 
                (wich is the latter, with the addition of a blacklist) both with exact and approximate inference.
                Conditional probability tables were plotted in order to check if probabilities were consistent with 
                the assumptions emerging from the pre-processing step.

			<p> This work of thesis consists in the creation of a framework in which is possible to define templates for complex SPARQL queries
                over the ontology "DBpedia" and instantiate them, in order to create a dataset
                where each entry is an instance of a SPARQL query with an associated natural
                language query, the answers, the involved entities, relationships and modifiers
                of the query.
                The whole project was developed in Python by using a SPARQL wrapper, gingerit, which was needed in order to correct automatically the query expressed
                in natural language, and the JSON format for the dataset serialization.</p></div>
